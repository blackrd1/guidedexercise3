## Your First Kaggle Competition

[Kaggle](<https://www.kaggle.com/>) is a data science community that hosts competitions. We're going to host our very own Kaggle style competition for this assignment. 

### Outcome

Your goal is to predict _log_ inflation-adjusted box office take, `box_office_a`, from a dataset containing information on movies released since 2000.  

### Criteria

We will use log root mean square error for this competition. This is the same rmse we've been using in class. 

### Prize

The prize will be the best one we can possible give you: the respect of your peers. 

### How it works

We will give you two datasets. The first `movie_train.Rds` contains complete information on 4,338 movies. The second, `movie_test.Rds` will have data on 482 movies, but will not contain any informatin on the outcomes. You need to train a model on the `movie_train` data and then generate predictions from the `movie_test` data. We will compare your predictions with the actual box office take of the movies in the testing dataset, then report your rmse back to you. 

You may NOT use any other data sources to  supplement what we give you. Please stick with this rule, this is just for fun in any case. 

### Submission

You need to send us a .csv file (use `write_csv` to export it) containing only two elements. The first column should be `imdbid`, the second column-- predicted box office take--- should be `pred`. We will calculate the rmse for you and report your score on the dates listed below. Please email your results to the class email address. 

### Reporting Scores

We will report your score to you on the following dates, provide we have a submission at that time:

November 1, November 3, November 5, November 7

  country <- as.character(country_list[i,]) # Save current country as chr type
  str <- str_replace_all({{country}}, "[^a-zA-Z]", "") # Filter to only letters

}
```

### Combine 3 Production Columns and Create Binary Var Columns for each Production Type

```{r}
production_table <- movie_train %>% 
  group_by(production1) %>% # Group by types of productions seen in data set
  count() %>%
  arrange(by=-n) # Arrange from least to most common
glimpse(production_table)

total_productions <- colSums(production_table[,-1])

production_table_above_threshold <- production_table %>%
  filter(n/total_productions >= 0.005 & production1 != "N/A")
production_list <- production_table_above_threshold[1] # Generate list (1 col) of production types
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(production_list)) { # Iterate through our production list
  production <- as.character(production_list[i,]) # Save current production as chr type
  str <- str_replace_all({{production}}, "[^a-zA-Z]", "") # Filter to only letters
  movie_train <- movie_train %>% # Create new column with name equal to the current production and check to see if any of the three production columns are that kind. If they are we will set this value to 1. Otherwise we will set it to 0.
  mutate({{str}} := if_else(((!is.na(production1) & production1== {{production}}) | (!is.na(production2) & production2== {{production}}) | (!is.na(production3) & production3== {{production}})), 1, 0))
}
```


### Create Log(Box Office) col
```{r}
movie_train<-movie_train%>%
  mutate(log_boxoffice_a=log(boxoffice_a))
```

Now, we have completed the creation of binary categories for each of the above threshold genres, directors, writers, actors, languages, countries, and productions. This means that we can now use these variables in our Lasso analysis below along with the other relevant variables in our data set. We will now drop the columns genre1, genre2, ... , production1, etc. as these are no longer needed.

```{r}
movie_train <- movie_train %>%
  select(-genre1, -genre2, -genre3, -director1, -director2, -director3, -actor1, -actor2, -actor3, -writer1, -writer2, -writer3, -language1, -language2, -language3, -country1, -country2, -country3, -production1, -production2, -production3, -boxoffice_a, -plot, -runtime, -awards, -metascore, -released, -imdbid)
```



## Lastly, we will repeat the above data processing for the testing data set
